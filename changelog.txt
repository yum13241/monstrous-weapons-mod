This is the changelog. The newest changes are at the TOP.

v1.6


BIGGEST UPDATE YET!

Bug fixes and fixing the changelog. Also split up the decorate files. The test map now works. Also returned the fist to normal damage so berserk isn't broken. FINALLY. FIXED. THE. DAMN. PISTOL. BUG.
Oh, and a new pistol replacement (for playing Doom) and Chex Quest 3 WORKS!

At the CHOOSE YOUR GAME screen, you __can__ pick a game (which is just a class) which you aren't playing but there is basically no benefit. It breaks the game. This menu should never appear, and Zandronum doesn't support filter folders (uggh) so a separate addon is made for Chex Quest 3. This addon requires the main mod to function, and musn't be loaded when playing Doom.

Restored better fist from Eon Weapons RC8.1.

[TODO] Add new weapon sprites for all weapons. 
Now the project is licensed under WTHPL3.

v1.5

Improved the chaingun.

v1.4

Oh boy, where do I start?

Made chaingun faster, made fist more powerful, chainsaw is faster to compensate, grenades are much better now, grenade sounds are in as well. Now the BFG altfire fires 3 railgun shots after the ball blast. And the balls bounce too! But only 3 times for balance reasons.

From the README.TXT file:

"After the green and red ball blast, there will be 3 railgun shots, one centered, and one 10
degrees to the right, and another 10 degrees to the left. The balls bounce 3 times too!"


ALSO, since I FINALLY fixed the pistol animation bug (by shortening its tick length) that plauged 
the Zandronum version, I can now FINALLY merge both versions! Hurray!


===LEGALESE INCOMING!===


The project is also now licensed under the WTHPL version 2. Older versions retain their WTHPL
version 1 license as the WTHPL version 1 does NOT allow relicensing under any other license.
WTHPL version 2 contains exceptions for relicensing under most GNU GPL licenses (in particular, 
GNU GPL v2 is NOT ALLOWED because it doesn't forbid tivozation [vendor lock-in] ) AND newer
WTHPL versions.

In other words, versions 1.3 and below are forever under WTHPL version 1 because I DID NOT
add an exception for upgrading or switching to most GNU GPL licenses.


===LEGALESE OVER!===
