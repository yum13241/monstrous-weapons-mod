This is the changelog. The newest changes are at the TOP.


v1.4

Oh boy, where do I start?

Made chaingun faster, made fist more powerful, chainsaw is faster to compensate, grenades are much better now, grenade sounds are in as well. Now the BFG altfire fires 3 railgun shots after the ball blast. And the balls bounce too! But only 3 times for balance reasons.

From the README.TXT file:

"After the green and red ball blast, there will be 3 railgun shots, one centered, and one 10
degrees to the right, and another 10 degrees to the left. The centered one happens before the 
right and left ones do. The right and left ones fire at the same time. The balls bounce 3 times too!"


ALSO, since I FINALLY fixed the pistol animation bug (by shortening its tick length) that plauged 
the Zandronum version, I can now FINALLY merge both versions! Hurray!


===LEGALESE INCOMING!===


The project is also now licensed under the WTHPL version 2. Older versions retain their WTHPL
version 1 license as the WTHPL version 1 does NOT allow relicensing under any other license.
WTHPL version 2 contains exceptions for relicensing under most GNU GPL licenses (in particular, 
GNU GPL v2 is NOT ALLOWED because it doesn't forbid tivozation [vendor lock-in] ) AND newer
WTHPL versions.

In other words, versions 1.3 and below are forever under WTHPL version 1 because I DID NOT
add an exception for upgrading or switching to most GNU GPL licenses.
