MNU_CHOOSECLASS = "CHOOSE YOUR GAME (shouldn't ever see)"; //hack to make the class menu say what I just wrote to make it more professional, if someone knows how to force the player a certain class depending on the game please let me know. Update: This gross hack now goes unused in GZDoom. but not Zandronum for having no filter folder support. Update 2: This should never appear. The mod kinda-sorta feels like spaghetti code. Thanks Zandro for the split! (it's devs aren't bad people, the BAD thing about Zandronum is its sheer outdatedness, Zandronum isn't inherently bad)
