             TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. You just DO WHAT THE HELL YOU WANT TO, but if you create a derivative work,
  you MUST change the name and give credit to the original creator 
  (in this case, yum13241).
  
  1. You are NOT allowed to further restrict the license. In essence, it is 
  share-alike. In other words, this project MUST REMAIN under the WTHPL. You
  are, allowed to make changes to the license, if you only use the license.
  An EXCEPTION is made for the GNU GPL family of licenses. You are allowed to transfer a project
  using this license to any GNU GPL license that forbids tivozation (vendor lock-in). Therefore,
  GNU GPL v2 is NOT ALLOWED. GNU GPL v3 is ALLOWED because it forbids tivozation. GNU LGPL 
  and GNU AGPL licenses are allowed if they forbid tivozation. Therefore, WTHPL -> GPL family
  licenses that forbid tivozation is ALLOWED, but the same is not true in reverse due to the
  conditions of the GNU GPL.
  
  
  You are ALSO ALLOWED to relicense a project under a newer version of the WTHPL starting
  from version 2 onwards.
 
  
  2. If you distribute a verbatim copy of this mod, you MUST keep everything
  intact. Otherwise it is a derivative work and you must give credit to the 
  original creator and keep the license intact.
  
  3. You are only allowed to modify the license if you use it in a different
  work.
  
  4. Any project using this license must have its source code free to see,
  learn from, and modify. In other words, the project must be free software.
  
  5. If you make a new version of this license, you cannot call yours the WTHPL.
  
  6. You CANNOT claim a derivative work as the original, or misrepresent 
  the origins, or ANYTHING.
  
  7. This mod is free software. It comes without any warranty, to
     * the extent permitted by applicable law. You can redistribute it
     * and/or modify it under the terms of the Do What The Hell You Want
     * To Public License, Version 1, as published by yum13241. See
